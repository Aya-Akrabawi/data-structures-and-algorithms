# Challenge Summary
Review a pseudocode, then trace the algorithm by stepping through the process with a sample array. write down step-by-step output after each iteration through some sort of visual.

## Pseudocode
```
  InsertionSort(int[] arr)
  
    FOR i = 1 to arr.length
    
      int j <-- i - 1
      int temp <-- arr[i]
      
      WHILE j >= 0 AND temp < arr[j]
        arr[j + 1] <-- arr[j]
        j <-- j - 1
        
      arr[j + 1] <-- temp
```

## Solution
