# Trees
create class named tree to apply binary tree termonolgy

## Challenge
manipulate the order of the nodes by three methods.

## Approach & Efficiency
big O : o(n)

## API

1-  a method named add that accepts a value, and adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.


2- a method named contains that accepts a value, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.


3- a method for each of the depth first traversals called preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.

4- method named find-maximum-value that return the maximum value stored in the tree.
