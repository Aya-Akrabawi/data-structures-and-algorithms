# queue with stacks
Create a brand new PseudoQueue class. Do not use an existing Queue. Instead, this PseudoQueue class will implement our standard queue interface (the two methods listed below), but will internally only utilize 2 Stack objects.


## Challenge
create and practice on Stacks with Queues

API
** for Staks:

* method called enqueue(value) which inserts value into the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
* method called dequeue() which extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
